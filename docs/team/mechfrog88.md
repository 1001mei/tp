### Project: iBook

IBook is an inventory recording system for storekeepers to manage incoming and outgoing products in a store.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Popup window
  * What it does: Add popup window for trivial commands (Add/Update/Delete) for (Product/Item)
  * Justification: User does not have to remember the syntax for trivial commands

* **New Feature**: Discount Feature
  * What it does: Automatic calculate discount price for expiring item
  * Justification: User can sell expiring item at a much faster rate. This will reduce wastage and boost sales

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=mechfrog88&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Improved the application's UI/UX

* **Documentation**:

#### 3.2.3 Navigating around

The main mode of navigation in iBook is through the Command Line Interface (CLI). You can enter commands into the command box and press `Enter` to execute them. The results window would then display the results from executing the command. The table would also update accordingly based on the command ran.

Alternatively, you can also interact with the application through buttons, such as the `Add Product` button, where a popup would be displayed for you to enter the different fields once it is clicked.

#### 3.2.4 Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n:NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n:Maggie`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n:NAME [t:TAG]` can be used as `n:Maggie c:noodle` or as `n:Maggie`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n:NAME c:CATEGORY`, `c:CATEGORY n:NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

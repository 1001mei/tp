#### 2.2.3 Navigating around

The main mode of navigation in iBook is through the Command Line Interface (CLI). You can enter commands into the command box and press `Enter` to execute them. The results window would then display the results from executing the command. The table would also update accordingly based on the command ran.

Alternatively, you can also interact with the application through buttons, such as the `Add Product` button, where a popup would be displayed for you to enter the different fields once it is clicked.

#### 2.2.4 Command Format

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are additional user inputs supplied to a command.<br>
  e.g. in `add n:NAME`, `NAME` is an input which can be supplied as `add n:Maggie Mee`.

* Inputs in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n:NAME [t:TAG]`, both `n:Maggie Mee c:noodle` and `n:Maggie Mee` are acceptable.

* Inputs of a command can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n:NAME c:CATEGORY`, `c:CATEGORY n:NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extra inputs for commands that do not take in any (such as `exit`, `list`, `expired`, `out-of-stock`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. the command `exit 123` will be interpreted as `exit`.

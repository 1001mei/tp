### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/ui/i.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultWindow`, `Table`, `Popup` etc. The `MainWindow` and `UiComponent` inherits from `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

`UiComponent` is an abstract class that contains a reference to the MainWindow. Notice how all the other Ui components inherit from `UiComponent`. This is to enable the individual Ui components to navigate back to MainWindow. The navigation is helpful for certain Ui components that requires to call the methods resides in MainWindow. For example, `CommandBox` calls method `executeCommand` in `MainWindow` when user enter a command.

#### The Structure of The Table Component

![Structure of the Table Component](images/UiTableDiagram.png)

The diagram above shows the internal structure of the `Table` component.

The `MainWindow` contains a `Table`, which holds a `TableHeader` and a `TableContent`.

`TableContent` has multiple `ProductCard` that represents each `Product` in the table.

Here, `ProductCard` and `TableContent` has a dependency on `Model` to get the attributes of a `Product`

As usual, all Ui components are inherited from `UiComponent` for navigability back to `MainWindow`

#### The Structure of The Popup Component

![Structure of the Popup UI](images/UiPopupDiagram.png)

The diagram above shows the internal structure of the `Popup` component.

Firstly, `MainWindow` contains a `PopupHandler` that provides several APIs for operations related to popup.

Every popup is inherited from the `Popup` abstract class which contains the implementation of the common attribute across all popups. The abstract class `Popup` is again inherited from `UiComponent` for navigability to `MainWindow`

Popups depends on several classes in `Logic` and `Model`.

`Model` is needed to show the relevant product information to the user. `Logic` on the other hand, is required to forge commands to add product and update product.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Product` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `IBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a product).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `IBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `IBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the IBook data i.e., all `Product` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueProductList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Product` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Product>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the current `ProductFilter` which is applied to the _filtered_ list.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

A more detailed representation of the `Product` class is shown below which includes more details regarding the `Item` class.

* The `Item` object enforces a two-way relationship with `Product`.
* An `Item` can only belong to one `Product`, but a `Product` can contain many `Item`.

<img src="images/DetailedModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ibook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both IBook data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `IBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one when only one functionality is needed.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Product filters

#### Implementation

The implementation of product filter is facilitated by the `ProductFilter` class and the `AttributeFilter` class. `ProductFilter` contains a list of `AttributeFilter` which specifies the filter for the individual attributes of a product that was queried in the `Find` command. Both the `ProductFilter` as well as the `AttributeFilter` has a `test` method to test whether a given `Product` fulfils the query specified by the user.

Given below is the class diagram of the `ProductFilter` class and the `AttributeFilter` class.

<img src="images/ProductFilterClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The following sequence diagrams shows how the `Find` command works:

The sequence diagram below shows how the `FindCommand` object is created:

<img src="images/FindCreationSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

The sequence diagram below shows how the `FindCommand` object is executed:

<img src="images/FindExecutionSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

As different attributes have different constraints, the `parse` method in the `FindCommandParser` checks that all the attributes are valid before creating the `AttributeFilter` and the `FindCommand` objects. If there is any attribute that is invalid, an exception would be thrown.

When executing the `FindCommand`, the `clearProductFilters` method of the `Model` would be called to ensure that previous filters are removed. The individual `AttributeFilter`s would then be applied by calling the `addProductFilter` method in the `Model` class. This would then update the list of filtered products by checking if the product fulfils every condition in the `AttributeFilter` (i.e. returning true for when the `test` method is called with `Product` as the argument). The updated filtered product list would then be displayed in the GUI.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** Some `AttributeFilter`s like `NameFilter`, `CategoryFilter` and `DescriptionFilter` has the capability to do partial matching so the query given does not have to exactly match the actual product.  

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to filter the products:**

* **Alternative 1:** Create a single predicate as the product filter.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: User does not have fine-grained control over the current filter.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a `ProductFilter` that contains a list of `AttributeFilter`
    * Pros: Allow the UI to display the individual `AttributeFilter` being applied and delete any one of them individually.
    * Cons: More complicated to implement.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `ReversibleIBook`. It extends `IBook` with versions of methods that are reversible and uses `StateChangeRecorder` to record all changes made to `IBook`, which internally store changes as a `StateChange`. `ReversibleIBook` implements the following operations:

* `ReversibleIBook#prepareForChanges()`â€‰â€”â€‰Prepares a clean workspace to record next possible changes.
* `ReversibleIBook#saveChanges()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves all changes made to `Ibook` as a `StateChange` (recorded and stored in `StateChangeRecorder`).
* `ReversibleIBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Reverts the most currently changes.
* `ReversibleIBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the most currently undone changes.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#prepareIBookForChanges()`, `Model#saveIBookChanges()`, `Model#undoIBook()` and `Model#redoIBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ReversibleIBook` will be initialized, which in turn initializes `StateChangeRecorder` with a `stateChanges` list consisting of zero `StateChange` record.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState0.png" width="550" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 3` command to delete the 3rd product in the iBook. The `delete` command calls `Model#saveIBookChanges()` after its execution, causing changes made to iBook to be recorded as a `StateChange` and stored in the `stateChanges` list. The `currentStateChange` is now pointing to this most recent `StateChange`.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState1.png" width="550" />

Step 3. The user executes `update 1 n:Maggieâ€‹` to add a new product. This command also calls `Model#saveIBookChanges()`, causing another `StateChange` to be saved into the `stateChanges` list.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState2.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveIBookChanges()`, so no `StateChange` will be saved into the `stateChanges` list.

</div>
<br>
Step 4. The user now decides that adding the product was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoIBook()`, which will get and execute the actions needed to revert this change. `currentStateChange` will then move once to the left, pointing to the most recent `stateChange` (with respect to the state of `IBook` after the `undo` command).

<img src="images/UndoRedoState3.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStateChange` is not pointing to a valid `StateChange` (for example when there is no record in the `stateChanges` list), then there are no changes to revert. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoIBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>
<br>
The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<img src="images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png" width="950" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>
<br>
The `redo` command does exactly the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoIBook()`, which moves the `currentStateChange` once to the right, pointing to the previously reverted changes, then perform the actions needed to restore them back.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStateChange` is pointing at the latest record of the `stateChanges` list, then there are no reverted changes to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoIBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>
<br>
Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not make any changes to `Ibook`, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#saveIBookChanges()`, `Model#undoIBook()` or `Model#redoIBook()`. Thus, state change records in `StateChangeRecorder` remain unchanged.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState4.png" width="550" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which again will call `Model#saveIBookChanges()` at the end of its execution. Since the `currentStateChange` is not pointing at the end of the `stateChanges` list, all state changes after the `currentStateChange` will be cleared. Reason: It does not make sense to redo the `update 1 n:Maggieâ€‹` command. This is the convention that most modern desktop applications follow.

<img src="images/UndoRedoState5.png" width="550" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/SaveChangesActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire `Ibook`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Individual method that makes changes to `IBook` knows how to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the product being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual method are correct.
